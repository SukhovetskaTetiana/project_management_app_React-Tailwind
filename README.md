# Project Management App

The provided code is for a React application that appears to be a project management tool. It allows users to create and manage projects, as well as add and delete tasks.

**Key Features:**

- _Project Management_: Users can create new projects with titles, descriptions, and due dates. They can also view a list of existing projects and select a specific project to work on.

- _Task Management_: Within a selected project, users can add new tasks by providing a description for each task. The application manages a list of tasks associated with the current project. Users can also delete tasks from the list.

- _Project Selection_: The application keeps track of the currently selected project. It displays a different view depending on whether a project is selected or not.

- _Input Validation_: The application validates user input for both project creation and task addition. It prevents users from saving projects or tasks with missing information.

**Technical Implementation:**

The code utilizes React for the user interface and component management. It also leverages several React features like useState for managing application state, and useRef for creating references to DOM elements.

For styling, the project uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind provides pre-defined classes for styling various aspects of the UI, like colors, spacing, and fonts. This allows for rapid UI development without writing a lot of custom CSS.

**Overall Summary:**

This React application demonstrates a basic project management tool with functionalities for creating and managing projects, adding and deleting tasks, and handling project selection. It utilizes React for UI development and Tailwind CSS for styling.
